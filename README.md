# Stylelint Config Pixel

Strict Stylelint configuration with Prettier maintained by Pixel Perfect Agency.

## Rationale

This package is designed for usage with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
We want to have a strict Stylelint configuration that is consistent across projects. We also want to use Prettier to format our code. This package implements the configuration we use in our projects.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev stylelint-config-pixel
```

## Usage

Or add the following to your `.stylelintrc`:

```json

    "extends": "stylelint-config-pixel",
    "rules": {
